# Set Node Name

This example demonstrates setting the Node Name and retrieving a list of all the nodes in a mesh, along with their names. Use of Node Names is essential to making sketches more portable and not relying on MAC addresses for communication, much like the Internet uses DNS.

Node Names are only shared every 60s, so name resolution is not available immediately after the mesh is joined.
